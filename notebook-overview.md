## [](notebooks/1_resistivity_to_metric_maps.ipynb)

This notebook contains the complete data-processing pipeline used in the study. Running it end-to-end reproduces all static figures included in the manuscript.
- By keeping both the workflow and figures in a single production notebook, researchers can regenerate every graphic with a single execution—eliminating the risk of outdated plots and keeping scientific communication clear and consistent.
- This separation of *storytelling order* (in the manuscript) from *processing order* (in the notebook) makes it easy to update results as the analysis evolves, without restructuring the narrative. Navigate to the notebook you want to interrogate, and press the power button to start a live jupyter session. You can then execute cells and temporarily modify data etc.

## [](notebooks/2_interactive_figure.ipynb)

To showcase the power of MyST and Curvenote, we provide a second notebook featuring interactive visualizations.
- All data required to run the notebook is included and will be accessible via the final repository link (TODO: add link). This makes the notebook fully self-contained and easy to explore independently.
- The interactive elements require a running Jupyter kernel—Navigate to [the interactive figure](#fig:interactive) in the main manuscript and press the play button. This will start a jupyter kernel and run the notebook behind the scenes.
